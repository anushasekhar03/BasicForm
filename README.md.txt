Role-Based Access Control Using JWT Authentication and Authorization Analysis

üìñ Overview
This project implements a secure and scalable system for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using JWT (JSON Web Token). It ensures users can only access resources authorized for their roles, enhancing application security. The system supports dynamic roles, enabling flexibility for complex use cases in modern applications.

The primary goal is to combine simplicity with robust authorization, providing a real-world example of token-based authentication in a microservice or monolithic environment.

üöÄ Key Features
User Registration and Authentication: Securely register users and validate their credentials during login.
JWT-Based Authorization:
Tokens are generated upon login.
Tokens carry essential information, such as user roles and expiry time.
Role Validation:
Assign roles (e.g., Admin, User) to users during sign-up.
Restrict access to APIs based on roles.
Stateless Architecture:
JWT eliminates the need for server-side session storage.
Scalability: The system can handle multiple users and roles with minimal overhead.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:

Backend:
Java 17
Spring Boot 3.x (for REST API development)
Hibernate (for ORM and database interactions)
Spring Security (for authentication and role-based access)
Database:
MySQL/PostgreSQL
Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless security
Build Tool:
Maven/Gradle

üß© Architecture
Sign-Up: Users provide their details, which are validated and stored in the database.
Login: Valid credentials return a signed JWT.
JWT Verification: JWT is validated for each request. Expired or tampered tokens are rejected.
Role Validation: API endpoints are protected based on roles.

üìä Workflow Diagram
The system follows the flow below:

Sign-Up: The client sends a sign-up request, and the server validates the input, checks for duplicates, and saves the user.
Login: The server generates a JWT if the credentials are valid.
Authorized Access: API requests are validated using the JWT to ensure proper role-based access control.
